## Component Code Size Guideline

- Ensure that the code for any new component does **not exceed 300 lines**.
- If a component's code grows beyond 300 lines, **split the code** and create a new file for the additional logic or subcomponents.
- Organize related files in the same directory for maintainability.
- Use clear and descriptive file names when splitting components.
