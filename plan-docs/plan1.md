## **48-Hour Iteration Plan**

### **Hour 0-12: Foundation & Core Strategy Builder** 
*Goal: Working strategy creation with basic validation*

**What to Build:**
- Simple UI for strategy configuration (RSI 20-80, Risk/Reward 1:2)
- Basic ERC8004 agent identity registration on-chain
- Strategy parameter storage structure
- Pyth price oracle integration for backtesting

**On-Chain Components:**
```solidity
// StrategyRegistry.sol
- registerStrategy(params, agentId) 
- Strategy struct: rsiLower, rsiUpper, riskReward, owner
```

**Off-Chain:**
- Backend calculates RSI from Pyth price feeds
- Test strategy against historical data
- Track input/output consistency

---

### **Hour 12-24: ERC8004 Validation & On-Chain Deployment**
*Goal: Trustless strategy validation using ERC8004*

**What to Build:**
- ERC8004 reputation registry implementation
- Validation mechanism for strategy consistency
- Deploy validated strategies as smart contracts
- Agent card creation for each strategy

**On-Chain Components:**
```solidity
// ERC8004 Integration
- AcceptFeedback() for strategy performance attestations
- ValidationRegistry for backtesting proofs
- ReputationScore based on win/loss ratio
```

**Key Innovation:** 
- Store strategy performance metrics on-chain
- Use ERC8004 to create verifiable reputation for strategies
- Validators can re-run backtests and attest to accuracy

---

### **Hour 24-36: Agentic Execution with x402 Payments**
*Goal: Autonomous strategy execution with payment rails*

**What to Build:**
- AI agent that executes trades based on strategy
- x402 payment integration for:
  - Paying for Pyth price feed updates
  - Paying for 1inch swap API calls
  - Paying for trade execution
- Connect to 1inch for optimal swap routing

**On-Chain Components:**
```solidity
// ExecutionEngine.sol
- executeStrategy(strategyId) with x402 payment verification
- Settlement contract for profit distribution
```

**Agent Flow:**
1. Agent monitors Pyth prices (pays via x402)
2. When RSI conditions met, request 1inch quote (x402 payment)
3. Execute swap if risk/reward ratio satisfied
4. Record performance on-chain (ERC8004 feedback)

---

### **Hour 36-44: Copy Trading & Marketplace**
*Goal: Public/private strategy marketplace with royalties*

**What to Build:**
- Strategy visibility toggle (public/private)
- Copy trading mechanism
- Royalty system (5-10% of profits to strategy creator)
- Leaderboard using The Graph for indexing

**On-Chain Components:**
```solidity
// StrategyMarketplace.sol
- subscribeToStrategy(strategyId) with payment
- executeWithRoyalty() - splits profits
- Public vs Private strategy access control
```

**The Graph Integration:**
- Subgraph to index all strategies
- Query top performing strategies
- Track royalty payments & volume

---

### **Hour 44-48: Polish, Demo & Integration**
*Goal: Working demo + documentation*

- Video demo showing full flow
- Deploy to Polygon/Base for low fees
- Create compelling presentation
- Document ERC8004 + x402 innovations

---

## **Technical Architecture**

### **On-Chain (Smart Contracts):**
```
1. StrategyRegistry (ERC8004 identity)
   - Store strategy parameters
   - Agent registration
   
2. ValidationRegistry (ERC8004 validation)  
   - Backtest proof verification
   - Performance attestations
   
3. ReputationRegistry (ERC8004 reputation)
   - Win/loss ratios
   - Historical performance
   
4. ExecutionEngine
   - Trade execution with x402 payments
   - Profit settlement
   
5. StrategyMarketplace
   - Copy trading subscriptions
   - Royalty distribution
```

### **Off-Chain (Backend Services):**
```
1. Strategy Builder Service
   - UI for parameter selection
   - Backtesting engine using Pyth historical data
   
2. Validation Service  
   - Re-runs strategies to verify consistency
   - Posts attestations via ERC8004
   
3. AI Agent (Autonomous Executor)
   - Monitors Pyth prices
   - Makes x402 payments for API calls
   - Executes trades via 1inch
   - Records performance on-chain
   
4. The Graph Subgraph
   - Index all strategies
   - Track performance metrics
   - Generate leaderboards
```

## **Key Innovations for Judges**

1. **ERC8004 for Strategy Trustlessness**: First use of ERC8004 for financial strategy validation - validators can independently verify strategy performance before deployment

2. **x402 for Autonomous Trading**: AI agents pay for their own infrastructure (price feeds, swap APIs) - truly autonomous DeFi agents

3. **Composable Strategy NFTs**: Strategies as ERC721 with royalty streams - creates new asset class

4. **Multi-Chain Agent Execution**: Same strategy deployed across Polygon/Base with consistent validation

---

## **Minimum Viable Demo Flow**

**For judges to see:**
1. User creates RSI strategy (20-80 bounds, 1:2 RR)
2. System backtests using Pyth → shows 65% win rate
3. ERC8004 validator confirms consistency → strategy gets reputation score
4. Strategy deployed on-chain as smart contract
5. AI agent executes trade:
   - Pays x402 for Pyth price update
   - Detects RSI < 20 (buy signal)
   - Pays x402 for 1inch quote
   - Executes swap
   - Records profit (8% gain)
6. Strategy set to public → another user copies it
7. Strategy earns 10% royalty on copycat's profits
8. The Graph shows leaderboard with your strategy #1

---

## **Stretch Goals (if time permits)**

- Multi-indicator strategies (RSI + MACD + Bollinger)
- Social features (strategy comments, ratings)
- Strategy DAOs (collective strategy management)
- Cross-chain strategy execution
- AI-generated strategy suggestions based on market conditions
